- Loading Angular Element on Container app
  - In Angular doesn't need to customize Webpack config, the chunk are already named correctly
- Structuring the Angular Element project
  - Contact list
    - Trying to style the list of contacts to seems better and still don't break HTML semantics
    - Pico was turned on, but have to be turned off later
    - Routing had to be added, but the changed the schematics on app creation
  - Creating Contacts Service
    - `nx generate @schematics/angular:service --name=contacts --project=contacts --path=apps/contacts/src/app/contacts --skipTests --no-interactive`
  - Moving Contact list to a List component and route
    - `nx generate @schematics/angular:component --name=list --project=contacts --style=none --flat --inlineTemplate --path=apps/contacts/src/app/contacts --skipTests --no-interactive`
    - It was needed to perform an initial navigation on `AppModule`, since we are controlling the Angular state by hand
    - It was also necessary to navigate using `skipLocationChange: true` to not conflict with the container app routes
      - If not set, when the user navigates to `/contacts` route the URL is replaced by `/`
      - `/contacts` route is located in the container app
      - `/` is the route controlled by the Angular Element
  - Create the edit component
    - `nx generate @schematics/angular:component --name=edit --project=contacts --style=none --flat --inlineTemplate --path=apps/contacts/src/app/contacts --skipTests --no-interactive`
    - Had to add `'contacts'` at the start of the routes, to match the container route
      - TODO: it needs to be removed
    - When navigating away from the Contacts section (click on navbar) and returning to it, the internal Angular Elements routing are not being updated
      - To reproduce
      - Navigate to Contacts
        - List of contacts are shown
      - Click to Edit a contact
        - A page to edit the selected contact are shown
      - Click on another item on Navbar (eg: Profile)
        - The contacts element is removed from the page
      - Navigate again to Contacts
        - The page that should be visible is the contact list
        - But the last edited contacted is displayed instead
        - Maybe a way to reflect the current route would be ok
      - TODO: don't know what to do yet
    - The initial navigation was changed to use the Router default
      - The logic using `.navigate['']` had some problems
      - But it's not the final version yet
  - Next steps
    - Create the edit route pointing to this new component
    - Configure the baseHref or deployUrl to match the container routing
    - The images used on the first lessons also needs to be changed
      - Those are referencing an old version of the app
